    <description>In this course students study the internal workings of modern operating
      systems. Topics include multiprocessing, memory management, file systems, and device
      drivers. Distributed operating systems and real time operating systems are also
      introduced. As part of this course students write a kernel module and/or device driver for
      an operating system chosen by the instructor.</description>

    <summary>In the laboratory the student turns the theory of operating systems into practice
      by implementing operating system components (drivers and/or other types of modules). In
      some cases the student creates or uses simulation software to demonstrate operating system
      functionality in a controlled way. An important object of the laboratory is to have the
      students work together as a team on at least one medium sized project.</summary>
