    <description>This course focuses on security issues associated with computers and computer
      networks. The course starts by covering cryptographic topics such as symmetric and public
      key cryptography, digital signatures, secure hashes, random number generation, and message
      authentication codes. Network security topics are also covered including secure protocols
      (SSL/TLS, IPsec), network attack methods, network authentication protocols (Kerberos), and
      firewalls. Finally the course covers host security matters such as building secure software,
      auditing, and intrusion detection.</description>

  <course-outcomes>
    <outcome>Understand cryptographic technology well enough to recommend appropriate use of the
      technology and to deploy the technology both in the context of system administration and
      software development. The student should be able to appreciate the mathematical basis of
      encryption technology, however they need not be able to formally verify the strength or
      correctness of cryptographic algorithms.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the details of at least one security protocol and be able to implement
      at least some aspects of it at either the administrative or software developmental
      capacity.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the technical details of the SSL/TLS protocol. The students should be
      able to configure and use the protocol, as well as understand its limitations and
      advantages.</outcome>
    <outcome>Describe how various network related attacks are performed as well as appropriate
      counter measures.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the operation of the IPsec network layer protocol and its limitations
      and advantages.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the purpose and limitations of firewalls.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the Kerberos authentication protocol.</outcome>
    <outcome>Use appropriate methods to build secure software that avoid buffer overflows, use
      language security features, and interact with security support libraries (for example,
      PAM).</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand the role of intrusion detection (at both the network and host levels),
      auditing, and similar technologies.</outcome>
    <outcome>Understand various host based security technologies such as POSIX capabilities,
      ACLs, and DAC vs MAC. The students should be able to deal with these technologies, at
      least to a degree, in both an administrative and software development capacity.</outcome>
    <outcome>Interact with other administrators to evaluate security risks, potential attacks,
      and appropriate countermeasures.</outcome>
